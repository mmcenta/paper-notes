# paper-notes

Inspired by [Daniel Takeshi's PaperNotes](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes).

Notes on papers I've read. I take brief notes summarizing and highlighting what I find interesting on the paper. These notes are not in-depth explanations of the techniques discussed in the paper but rather a high-level overview.
